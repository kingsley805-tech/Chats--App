## Frontend Mentor - Chat app CSS illustration
Design preview for the Chat app CSS illustration coding challenge

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for exploring this front-end coding challenge.

Frontend Mentor challenges are designed to enhance your coding skills by simulating real-world projects.

To successfully complete this challenge, you should have a strong grasp of HTML and CSS.

The Challenge
Your task is to recreate this feature illustration using HTML & CSS and make it resemble the design as closely as possible.

The only assets provided in this challenge are the image of the person in the app UI and the three images of the dog. All other elements must be created using HTML & CSS!

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
Bonus: Experience the chat interface animate upon the initial load.
Need assistance with the challenge? Join our Slack community and ask questions in the #help channel.

Where to Find Everything
Your objective is to build the project based on the designs inside the /design folder. Both a mobile and desktop version of the design are provided.

The designs are in static JPG format. Since JPGs lack detailed style information such as font-size, padding, and margin, you'll need to rely on your best judgment.

If you'd like to inspect the design in more detail, the design files (Sketch & Figma versions) are available for subscribers to our PRO membership.

All the necessary assets can be found in the /images folder, and they are already optimized.

For additional information on colors and fonts, consult the style-guide.md file.

Building Your Project
You are free to use any workflow you're comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but you are not obligated to follow it:

Start by initializing your project as a public repository on GitHub. Creating a repository will facilitate sharing your code with the community if you need assistance. If you're unsure how to do this, take a look at this Try Git resource.
Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will be helpful if you require assistance during the challenge, as you can share your project's URL with others. Several recommended methods are provided below.
Review the designs to plan out how you'll approach the project. This step is crucial for creating reusable styles using CSS classes.
Begin by structuring your content with HTML before adding any styles. Writing your HTML first can help maintain focus on creating well-structured content.
Write the base styles for your project, including general content styles like font-family and font-size.
Start adding styles from the top of the page and work your way down. Move on to the next section only after completing the area you're working on.
